# A thought of Django and RESTFUL.

Today I have tried using Django-RESTful framework. But find we will do so much useless things. For examples, the *serializer* process, and the complited database model design process. Because this project is for real-time mailiy, and have so much documented data, which let the design for RDBM is much difficute to do.

And, bacause the NodeJs will return the *JSON* very naturally, and support MongoDB very will, so I want to try change this project's main programming language to NodeJs + Redis + MongoDB. Python will focus on the data analyse and compute task.

## day 1

>> learn the mongoDB very quickly.

use NodeJS + Express + MongoDB to implements this project in Demo.
