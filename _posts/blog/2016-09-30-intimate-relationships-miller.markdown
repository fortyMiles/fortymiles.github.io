## Chapter 1 **The building Blocks of Relationships**

### THE NATURE AND IMPORTANCE OF INTIMACY

At the core of our social nature is our need for intimate relationships.

The foundamental building blocks of close relationships: 

>+ the cultures we inhabit
+ the experiences we encounter
+ the personalities we posses
+ the human origins we all share
+ the interaction we conduct

It's true that what's the intimacy is mutifaceted. However, researchers and laypeople agree that intimate relationships differ from more casual assocaitions in at least six specific ways: *knowledge, caring, interdependence, mutuality, trust,* and *commitment*.

#### Knowledge

Intimate parters have extensive personal, often condifential, **knowledge** about each other. They share information about their histories, preferences, feelings, and desires that they do not reveal to most of the other people.

#### Care

Intimate parterns also **care** about each other, feeling more affection for one another that they do for most others. 

*Intimacy increases when people believe that their parterns know, understand , and appreciate them.*


#### Indenpendence & mutuality

Between intimates, the extend to which they need and influence each othe, is frequent, strong, diverse, and enduring influence.

And they recognize the overlap between their lives and think of themselves as 'us' instead of 'me' and 'her/him'.


#### Trust

People expect that no undue harm will result from their intimate relationships, and they expect their parterns to be reponsive to their needs and connected for their walfare.

When such trust is lost, people often become wary and reduce the openness and interdependence that characterize closeness. 


#### Committed

They expect their parterships to continue indefinitely, and the invest the time, effort, and resources that are needed to realize that goal. If not, people who were once very close may find themselves less and less interdependent and knowledgable about each other as time gose by. 

### THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURE
